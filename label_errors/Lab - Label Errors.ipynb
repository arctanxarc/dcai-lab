    "# Lab â€” Label Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab highlights data-centric AI techniques (using [confident learning](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125)) to improve the accuracy of an XGBoost classifier on a noisy dataset that has label errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DCAI techniques demonstrated in this lab involve optimizing the dataset itself rather than altering the model's architecture or hyperparameters. As a result, it is possible to achieve further improvements in accuracy by fine-tuning the model in conjunction with the newly enhanced data, but that is not the focus of this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establish a baseline [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/) model accuracy on the original data\n",
    "- Automatically find mislabeled data points by:\n",
    "    - Computing out-of-sample predicted probabilities\n",
    "    - Estimating the number of label errors using confident learning\n",
    "    - Ranking errors, using the number of label errors as a cutoff in identifying issues\n",
    "- Remove the bad data\n",
    "- Retrain the exact same XGBoost model to see the improvement in test accuracy"

We are careful to only use these true grades for evaluation, not for model training.\n",

    "_Advanced topic_: you might notice that the above `cl_issue_idx` differs in length (by a little bit) from our `issue_idx`. The reason for this is that we implemented a slightly simplified version of the algorithm in this lab. We skipped a calibration step after computing the confident joint that makes the confident joint have the true noisy prior $p(labels)$ (summed over columns for each row) and also add up to the total number of examples. If you're interested in the details of this, see equation 3 and the subsequent explanation in the [paper](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125)."
